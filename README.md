## Situation
With the record number of new investors following the "COVID" crash of 2020, I was interested in examining the reliability of stock news headlines in conveying the general sentiment of any particular stock. (Note that I was not necessarily interested in using this information for any trading strategy, I was merely interested in the sentiment portrayed by mass media and financial news outlets).
